          Your office isn’t just a place to sit with a laptop — it’s a key driver of productivity
          and employee wellbeing.

        <h3>Natural Light</h3>
        <p>
          Access to natural light reduces stress, increases alertness, and improves mood.
          Bright, open spaces help teams feel energised throughout the day.
        </p>

        <h3>Ergonomic Furniture</h3>
        <p>
          Poor seating and cramped desks cause discomfort and health issues. Premium offices
          feature ergonomic setups that support long-term wellbeing.
